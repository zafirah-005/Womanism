## How we built it
“We built Womanism with a diverse tech stack and strong collaboration tools. The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for an intuitive interface, while Python and Java powered the backend logic. We integrated APIs for live location sharing, SOS alerts and directions to the nearest hospital or police station. To support teamwork and version control, we used Git and GitHub extensively. Bolt was also used to speed up development and ensure seamless integrations. Beyond code, we relied on books, online resources, and real-life stories for inspiration, ensuring the app reflects both technical strength and lived experiences. Womanism is not just built with technology, but with empathy and innovation combined.”
## Challenges we ran into
API Integration: Connecting live location services and SOS alerts was complex—we had to troubleshoot delays and accuracy issues.
Data Privacy: Since we deal with sensitive health data, ensuring secure storage and protection was a major challenge.
Language Accessibility: Making content available in both English and Hindi required extra effort in translation and cultural sensitivity.
User Experience: Balancing multiple features (tracking, journaling, safety tools) while keeping the app simple and user-friendly was tricky.
Time & Resources: As a team, we relied on books, online resources, and trial-and-error to overcome technical gaps.
Taboo Barrier: Creating educational content around menstruation meant addressing stigma and ensuring it was approachable and respectful.
“Every challenge became a lesson and overcoming them shaped Womanism into a stronger, more inclusive platform.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Impact First: We’re proud that Womanism goes beyond just being an app—it educates rural women about period health, breaking taboos in both English and Hindi.

All-in-One Solution: We combined period tracking, mental wellness tools, journaling, grounding exercises and safety features like SOS alerts and hospital/police locators into one platform.

Tech + Heart: We built it using APIs, Python, Java, Bolt, Git/GitHub and more—but also drew from books, resources and lived experiences to make it meaningful.

Team Resilience: Despite challenges, we collaborated, learned on the go, and turned obstacles into learning opportunities.
